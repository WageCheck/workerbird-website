            <p>
                This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on
                Workerbird's website or our app for iPhone and any other devices and
                platforms.
            </p>
        <h3>Information we collect</h3>
            <p>
                New Workerbird accounts are created in connection with your mobile phone number, 
                with a one time password sent to the user via SMS. Your phone number is stored in a private, 
                secure database managed by Google. It will only be used for authentication purposes, and to 
                improve spam and abuse prevention across Google services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We store information from your tracking in order to present you with a record of your 
                information and give you insights into your data.
            </p>
            <h3>Technical basics</h3>
            <p>
                The application uses silent notifications in the authentication process. We never use 
                notifications for other purposes such as marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use a token in the app to keep you logged in. Your tracking data is stored locally 
                on your phone and in a secure database. This backs up your data, allows us to provide you 
                with valuable insights, and facilitates continual improvement of the app.
            </p>
        <h3>Information usage</h3>
            <p>
                We do not share any personal information with outside parties. Where Workerbird users have 
                expressly agreed to share their data anonymously, we may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with 
                outside parties, such as the average length of commute or working day.
            </p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.  All data is 
                encrypted and sent via HTTPS to our server, which is managed by Google. Workerbird stores your 
                data in a secure database. No one outside of Workerbird has access to your data, aside from you.
            </p>
        <h3>Deleting information</h3>
            <p>
                You may delete your account by emailing 
                <a href="mailto:privacy@workerbird.co.uk">privacy@workerbird.co.uk.</a> .
            </p>
            <p>
                Workerbird may delete your information at any time and for any reason,
                such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of
                idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.
            </p>
        <h3>Your Consent</h3>
            <p>
                By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.
            </p>
